# RobotARM
This is an implementation of Robotic 2R Arm using Forward Kinematics geometry for the Robotics Course ICSI 660: Robotics at SUNY Albany. When I was doing the HW there was not much information available on the net about a simple robot arm 2R to be made in 2D and implemented using Forward Kinematics. The underlying Mathematics was pretty simple, but most examples online were implementation of Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters for 3R arm using joints in 3D. Some were implementation of MATLAB APIs. As a result please enjoy the code if you get a HW about a Robotic 2R arm made with simple geometry in Python 2.7.
